## Bank tech test

The aim of this test is to write a programme that simulates a bank account, enabling a user to keep track of their balance while withdrawing or depositing money.

For simplicity, the bank is not required to connect to a database, so all transactions are stored in memory and will be lost at the end of the session. It is also not required to make a web interface for the application - users will interact with it via the command line.
